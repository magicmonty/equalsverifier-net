This is an effort for an .NET port of the [EqualsVerifier for Java](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier)

EqualsVerifier can be used in .NET unit tests to verify whether the contract for the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods in a class is met.

Documentation is pending. In the mean time you can go to the documentation at the [original project's website](http://www.jqno.nl/equalsverifier)

**THIS IS HEAVILY ALPHA YET!!!**
